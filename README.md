## Fast Radius coding challenge

### Setup

You have clearly already unzipped.  Just navigate
to this director in a terminal window and run `yarn` 
to install any necessary JS modules.

## Before I continue...

Thank you for considering my application. This
was one of the most interesting coding challenges
I have been given. I really enjoyed the exercise.

# Possible commands:

### `yarn go`

Runs the example app in the development mode.<br />
This should meet the requirements of the coding
expectations.


### `yarn test`

Launches the Jest test runner, showing that I have
written several unit tests and they all pass.

### `yarn lint`

Runs ESLint against the code written in the
repo. Adhering to some minimal standards... 
given that nothing more was specified as a
requirement.

## Additional Info

There are additional files in the `data` directory,
including valid and invalid files.  If you want to run
the code against them, just invoke the javascript and
pass an argument referencing the data file.  For example:

    node ./src/parse.js ./data/valid1.stl

I made this as simple as the requirements specified.
It would certainly have been possible to put whiz-bang
React components all over the place, but I believe in
doing what is necessary, rather than making things
overly complex.

I hope that the code is fairly easy to follow, and I
look forward to any questions and/or discussion that 
may come out of it.  Thanks again!
